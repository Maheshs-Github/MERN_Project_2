🛍️ SHOPPER - E-commerce Web Application

Description:
 SHOPPER is a project for understanding and demonstrating my foundational knowledge of MERN stack technologies. It involves:
 Designing user interfaces using basic CSS and Bootstrap.
 Dividing the application into reusable, component-based architecture.
 Using React Router for navigation, and using useRef, useState, and useContext for managing and passing state.
 Learning how to send and retrieve data through APIs and backend integration.
 Validating and processing data using Express.js middlewares.
 Understanding the complete flow of a MERN application, from frontend interactions to backend handling and MongoDB storage.
